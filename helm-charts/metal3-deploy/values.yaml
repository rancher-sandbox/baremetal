# The metal3-deploy chart is a parent chart that installs
# all of the other charts that a metal3 deployment needs,
# but doesn't actually deploy any services itself.

# The reference examples below are for a single node management cluster,
# connected to the to network where the baremental nodes (that it will
# be managing are located) via with it's 'ens4' network interface, with
# associated IP 192.168.20.5. The metal3 services will be automatically
# registered as members of the 'suse.baremetal' DNS domain.

# Define a global default for other charts to leverage.

  # NOTE: external-dns is required unless there are pre-existing methods that
  # create DNS hostname records for the Ironic ingress resources that are used
  # in bare metal provisioning. If using external-dns without pdns, a
  # supported external-dns DNS integration must be configured.
  # See for https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns for
